                Once in a while when I wake up.
                I find myself crying.
                The dream I must have had
                I can never recall.
                But...
                But...
                the sensation that I've lost something
                lingers for a long time after I wake up.
                I'm always searching
                for something, for someone.
                This feeling has possessed me
                I think from that clay...
                That day when the stars came falling.
                It was almost as if...
                as if a scene from a dream.
                Nothing more, nothing less
                than a beautiful view.
